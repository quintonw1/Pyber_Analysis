# Pyber_Analysis Challenge 5

An analysis was performed on PyBer ride sharing data to determine the allocation of revenue, drivers, and ride counts. The three categories were filtered by city types consisting of Suburban, Rural, and Urban. The comparison between the three city types allows PyBer to understand the business details of the different areas and ultimately make decisions to increase future profits. The table below contains the complete comparison showing the ride data, driver count, total fares, and the corresponding averages on a rider and driver basis. It is seen that the Urban city types see most of the traffic, and the Rural cities receiving the least amount of traffic.
